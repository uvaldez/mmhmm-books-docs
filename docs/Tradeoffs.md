# Tradeoffs

Due to time constraints, there are certain things that may not be possible to implement at this stage, but incorporating them would elevate this project to the next level.

1. **State Management.** We are using component state and props which is not bad since this is a small application but it can be improved by adding something like redux or zustand.
2. **Improve UI.** It can be more attractive.
3. **Zod or yup.** for form/data validation.
4. **Search/Filters.** We could add a search box or filter options for better UX.
5. **Forms.** Use form library like react-hook-forms
6. **Pagination.** Implement pagination, besides time reasons it also seems like the API doesn't support pagination.
7. **Storybook.** Improves development experience.
8. **Order books by recent.** Improves UX.
9. **Documentation.** It can definitely be improved.
11. **Testing.** No tests were added.
10. **API.** I don't know how the API it's implemented but things I would add are pagination, proper authentication, swagger.
